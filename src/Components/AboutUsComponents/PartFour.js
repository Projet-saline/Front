        During the academies, students have the opportunity to stay in the heart of the Saline royale. They are accommodated in the 3-star hotel of the Saline royale. <br />
        Single, twin and double rooms as well as dormitories provide accommodation for students, teachers and technical teams. The rooms have been refurbished and decorated by the designers, architects and authors Jean-Michel Wilmotte and Damien Cabiron and thus offer an exceptional living environment for the Saline royale Academy masterclasses. <br />
        The Saline royale also has a restaurant, offering an all-inclusive formula.
